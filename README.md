# Multiplication_table

A new Flutter project.

## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application.

## Introduction:
Flutter is an open-source UI software development kit created by Google. It is used to develop cross-platform applications for Android, iOS, Linux, macOS, Windows, Google Fuchsia, and the web from a single codebase. Flutter apps are written in the Dart language and make use of many of the language's more advanced features.

The basic component in a Flutter program is a "widget", which can in turn consist of other widgets. A widget describes the logic, interaction, and design of a UI element with an implementation similar to React. Unlike other cross-platform toolkits such as React Native and Xamarin which draw widgets using native platform components, Flutter renders widgets itself on a per-pixel basis.

## AppLication Interface:
This app consists of two screen one is homescreen where user enters the number and other one is taskscreen where multiplication Table of corresponding number is printed.
